The "Shellby" is a simple UNIX command interpreter that allows users to execute commands from either a file or standard input. It can be invoked interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt ("$") and waits for a command. If command line arguments are provided, the shell reads commands from the specified file.

When a command is received, Shellby tokenizes it into words, with the first word as the command and the remaining words as arguments. The shell performs the following actions:

1. If the command is a shell builtin, it invokes the corresponding built-in function.
2. If the command is not a builtin, the shell searches for an executable file in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
3. If an executable file is found, the shell executes the program with the given arguments.

Shellby returns the exit status of the last executed command. A return status of zero indicates success, while a non-zero status indicates failure. If a command is not found, the return status is 127, and if a command is found but not executable, the return status is 126.

In interactive mode, Shellby ignores the Ctrl+C signal but exits upon receiving the end-of-file signal (Ctrl+D). The shell supports variable replacement, where variables prefixed with "$" are substituted with their corresponding values. It also recognizes special variables like "$?" (return value of the last program) and "$$" (current process ID).

Shellby supports command separators (;), logical operators (&& and ||), and comments (lines starting with "#"). The shell provides built-in commands such as cd (change directory), alias (handle aliases), exit (exit the shell), env (print the current environment), setenv (initialize or modify environment variables), and unsetenv (remove environment variables).

The man page also lists related system calls and functions, as well as references to the sh(1) and dash(1) shell man pages.
